# Clj Guarda

Clojure implementation of a very simple hash keeper. It's a git-like application that stores associated MD5 hashes to identify file tampering.

## Installation

To build from the source code you'll need to use Leiningen. Download from https://leiningen.org/.

Also you can download .jar executable from the project's Github releases section.

## Usage

Run the executable as .jar

    $ java -jar guarda-x.x.x-alias.jar [args]

Or run with `lein` (being on the project root path)

    $ lein run

## Options

The usage modes of Guarda and parameters definition must be setted as program args:

- **method**: defines which hash type is going to be used between:
  - `-hash`: simple hash algorithm (MD5)
  - `-hmac`: hash with a key. With that method the key must follow the -hmac statement as a parameter setting.

- **option**: defines which mode Guarda is running it could be three diferent ones:
  - `-i`: The **init** mode. It reads a path three of a desired directory and stores a initial, ground truthly hashes.
  - `-t`: The **tracking** mode. It tracks the directory recalculating hashes and highlighting tampered, included or deleted files.
  - `-x`: The **exterminator** mode. It removes the Guarda current structure.

- **path**: defines the root directory that is going to be analysed.
  - Usage pattern: `-path /home/user` (relative path is supported)

- **output**: defines the output report filename that will be generated after executing the tracking mode.

## Examples

Create and store a path tree hashed structure:

```
$ java -jar guarda-x.x.x-alias.jar -i -path .
```

Using HMAC mode for initializing a structure:

```
$ java -jar guarda-x.x.x-alias.jar -i -path . -hmac password
```

Tracking a path tree against guarda stored structure:

```
$ java -jar guarda-x.x.x-alias.jar -t -path .
```

Removing guarda metadata by using exterminator mode:

```
$ java -jar guarda-x.x.x-alias.jar -x -path .
```

### Bugs

- There's a know bug in the function that verify if a path has hidden directories on it (guarda.core/is-hidden?) caused by a badly formatted regex expression. It's not spotting directories with a special character on it. `.guaca-mole` for instance is not matched because of the `-`.
